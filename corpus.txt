The Rembrandts Lyrics




"I'll Be There For You (Theme From Friends)"



So no one told you life was gonna be this way
Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A.
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but

I'll be there for you
(When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)

You're still in bed at ten and work began at eight
You've burned your breakfast, so far things are going great
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees that

I'll be there for you
(When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)

No one could ever know me
No one could ever see me
Seems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me
Someone to face the day with, make it through all the rest with
Someone I'll always laugh with
Even at my worst, I'm best with you, yeah!

It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year

I'll be there for you
(When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)

I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
('Cause you're there for me too)

"I'll Be There for You" is a song recorded by duo "The Rembrandts" as the theme song to the sitcom "Friends". The song was also released as the first single from the third studio album.


The original theme to the sitcom, which is under one minute long, was re-recorded as a three-minute song. After Nashville program director Charlie Quinn looped the original short version into a full-length track and broadcast it on radio, it became so popular that they had to re-record it. According to Phil S≈çlem, "Our record label said we had to finish the song and record it. There was no way to get out of it."
